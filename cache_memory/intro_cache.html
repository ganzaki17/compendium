		<h2>Motivation and Overview</h2>
			Programmers ideally want unlimited fast memory, we try to create the illusion of having a large amount of fast memory by implementing memory as a hierarchy.<br>
			Multiple levels of memory having different speends and sizes are used, we keep the smaller and faster memories closer to the prcessor and the slower, larger memories further away.<br>
		
		<h2>Cache Memory</h2>
			Cache is a small and fast buffer between the the processor and the memory.<br>
			Older unused data is replaced by newer data which is more likely to be used in the future.<br>
			<b>Temporal Locality: </b>If a data element is accessed, it is likely to be accessed again in the near future.<br>
			<b>Spatial Locality: </b>If a data element is accessed, the elements around it are likely to be accessed in the near future.<br>
		
		<h2>Cache Fundamentals</h2>
			<b>Block: </b>
			<b>Hit: </b>
			<b>Miss: </b>
			<b>Hit Time: </b>
			<b>Hit Rate/Miss Rate: </b>
		
		<h2>Cache Interaction</h2>
		<h2>Orgainization of Cache</h2>
		<h2>Addressing Cache</h2>
		<h2>Block Placement</h2>
			Block Placement answers the question where a block can be placed in the cache? There are three types of Block Placement
		<ol>
			<li>Fully Associative</li>
			<li>Set Associative</li>
			<li>Direct Mapped</li>
		</ol>

			<h4>Fully Associative</h4>
				A memory block can be placed into any block in the cache.
			<h4>Set Associative</h4>
				A memory block can be placed into any block in a set of blocks in the cache.<br>
				(Block number) mod (Number of sets)
			<h4>Direct Mapped</h4>
				A memory block can be placed only into one particular block in the cache.<br>
				(Block number) mod (Number of blocks in cache)
